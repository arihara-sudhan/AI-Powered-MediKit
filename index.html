            <h2>Heart</h2>
            <img src="https://assets.mayoclinic.org/content/dam/media/en/images/2023/02/09/enlarged-heart-in-heart-failure.jpg" alt="Heart Illustration">
            <p><strong>CARDIOMEGALY:</strong> Enlargement of the heart.</p>
            <p>Cardiomegaly, commonly referred to as an enlarged heart, occurs when the heart has to pump harder than normal. This may happen due to a range of conditions such as high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, or heart valve issues. The heart may enlarge in different ways: either the heart walls thicken, or the chambers of the heart expand, making it more difficult to pump blood efficiently.</p>
            <p><strong>Causes of Cardiomegaly:</strong> Common causes include hypertension (high blood pressure), which forces the heart to work harder, leading to thickening of the heart muscle. Coronary artery disease can block arteries and reduce blood flow, requiring the heart to pump with greater force. Heart valve disease, where valves are damaged or defective, increases the heart’s workload. Cardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart muscle, can cause the heart to become enlarged and weakened. Arrhythmias, or abnormal heart rhythms, can lead to heart enlargement. Congenital heart defects, conditions people are born with, may cause inefficiencies in heart function over time. Severe anemia forces the heart to pump more blood to deliver oxygen, potentially causing enlargement. Finally, thyroid disorders, either overactive or underactive, can affect heart function and size.</p>
            <p><strong>Symptoms of Cardiomegaly:</strong> The symptoms may include shortness of breath, especially during physical activity or while lying down. Fatigue and general weakness are common. Swelling in the legs, ankles, and feet (known as edema) may occur due to fluid retention. Irregular heartbeats, or arrhythmias, can cause a fluttering sensation in the chest. Some individuals experience dizziness or fainting spells, while others may suffer from chest pain or discomfort, particularly during exertion.</p>
            <p><strong>Diagnosis of Cardiomegaly:</strong> A chest X-ray is often the first test that reveals an enlarged heart. An echocardiogram (echo) is a more detailed ultrasound that provides information on the heart’s structure and function. An electrocardiogram (ECG) monitors the heart’s electrical activity, helping detect arrhythmias or stress on the heart muscle. Advanced imaging techniques like CT scans or MRIs offer a more detailed view of the heart and surrounding vessels. Blood tests are often used to detect underlying conditions, such as thyroid problems or infections that may contribute to cardiomegaly.</p>
            <p><strong>Treatment Options:</strong> Treatments include medications, surgery, and lifestyle changes. Diuretics help reduce fluid buildup, easing the heart’s workload. ACE inhibitors and ARBs relax blood vessels, lowering blood pressure and strain on the heart. Beta-blockers slow the heart rate and reduce blood pressure, which helps prevent the heart from overworking. Antiarrhythmics help control irregular heartbeats, which can exacerbate heart enlargement.</p>
            <p>Surgical options include coronary bypass surgery, which restores blood flow to the heart by bypassing blocked arteries. Heart valve repair or replacement is used when damaged valves contribute to cardiomegaly. In more severe cases, implantable devices such as pacemakers or defibrillators are used to regulate the heart’s rhythm or prevent sudden cardiac arrest. For the most serious cases, a heart transplant may be necessary.</p>
            <p>Lifestyle changes are critical for managing cardiomegaly. Adopting a heart-healthy diet that is low in sodium, unhealthy fats, and cholesterol is crucial to reduce heart strain. Regular, moderate physical activity can improve heart health, though it must be guided by a physician depending on the severity of the condition. Quitting smoking is essential, as it increases the risk of heart diseases and worsens cardiomegaly. Reducing alcohol intake can also prevent further heart damage. Stress management techniques, such as yoga, meditation, or counseling, can reduce strain on the heart.</p>
            <p><strong>Complications:</strong> If left untreated, cardiomegaly can lead to serious complications, including heart failure, arrhythmias, blood clots, stroke, or sudden cardiac arrest.</p>
            <p><strong>NORMAL:</strong> A healthy heart without abnormalities. Maintaining heart health through regular check-ups, a balanced diet, and exercise can prevent conditions like cardiomegaly.</p>

            <h2>Brain</h2>
            <img src="https://www.medicoverhospitals.in/images/cancer/brain-cancer.webp" alt="Brain Illustration">
            <p><strong>GLIOMA:</strong> A type of tumor that occurs in the brain and spinal cord.</p>
            <p>Gliomas originate from the glial cells, which support and protect the neurons in the central nervous system. These tumors can vary from low-grade (slow-growing) to high-grade (aggressive). Symptoms may include headaches, seizures, memory loss, or difficulty with movement and coordination. Gliomas are classified into several types, including astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and ependymomas, depending on the specific glial cell affected.</p>
            <p><strong>Treatment:</strong> Glioma treatment typically involves surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible. This is often followed by radiation therapy to target any remaining cancer cells. Chemotherapy may also be used, particularly for higher-grade gliomas, to slow or stop the tumor’s growth.</p>
            <p><strong>MENINGIOMA:</strong> A tumor that forms on membranes covering the brain and spinal cord.</p>
            <p>Meningiomas arise from the meninges, the layers of tissue that surround the brain and spinal cord. They are usually benign and slow-growing, though in some cases they can become malignant. Symptoms depend on the size and location of the tumor and may include headaches, vision problems, seizures, or changes in behavior. Meningiomas are more common in older adults and women.</p>
            <p><strong>Treatment:</strong> Small, asymptomatic meningiomas may simply be monitored. For larger or symptomatic tumors, surgery is often the first option to remove the tumor. If the tumor cannot be fully removed, radiation therapy may be used to control its growth.</p>
            <p><strong>PITUITARY TUMOR:</strong> A growth in the pituitary gland at the base of the brain.</p>
            <p>Pituitary tumors occur in the small gland located just below the brain, which is responsible for regulating many important hormones in the body. Most pituitary tumors are benign (non-cancerous), but they can affect hormone levels and lead to conditions such as Cushing's disease or acromegaly. Symptoms may include vision problems, headaches, and hormonal imbalances, causing changes in mood, energy levels, and physical appearance.</p>
            <p><strong>Treatment:</strong> Treatment typically involves surgery to remove the tumor, especially if it is pressing on the optic nerves or causing significant hormone imbalances. Radiation therapy may be used for residual tumors, and medications can help regulate hormone levels affected by the tumor.</p>
            <p><strong>NORMAL:</strong> Healthy brain tissue without abnormalities.</p>
            <p>The normal brain operates with healthy tissue, free from any abnormal growths or tumors. Proper brain function is essential for cognitive processes, sensory perception, motor function, and overall body regulation.</p>

            <p><strong>FRACTURED:</strong> A break or crack in the bone.</p>
            <p>A bone fracture can result from trauma, accidents, falls, or conditions like osteoporosis, which weakens bones. Fractures may be classified into several types, including simple (closed), compound (open), hairline, and comminuted (multiple fragments). Symptoms typically include pain, swelling, bruising, and difficulty moving the affected limb or area.</p>
            <p><strong>Treatment:</strong> Depending on the severity and type of fracture, treatment options include casting, where the bone is immobilized to allow healing, or surgery in cases of more complex fractures, such as inserting metal plates or rods. Physical therapy is often recommended during recovery to restore mobility and strength to the affected area.</p>
            <p><strong>NOT FRACTURED:</strong> Healthy bone without fractures.</p>
            <p>Healthy bones are strong and resilient, capable of supporting the body’s weight and withstanding physical stress. Maintaining bone health involves a balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D, regular weight-bearing exercise, and avoiding activities that put unnecessary strain on the bones.</p>
